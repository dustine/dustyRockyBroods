# Dusty Rocky Broods
Skip the middle step, breed rocks directly on Minecraft and get their ill gains.

Yes, **rocks**.

Mix a Megaspore (the flint-looking one) with some Microspores (the dust-looking one) onto a rock and wait. Eventually, the rock will mature and start releasing spores, infecting nearby **TOUCHING** rock. To get the gains you break these, not the original one, or you'll end up with a damaged Megaspore back.

- Spores take time to germinate before spreading. That's a gene.
- Max spread and spread speed are also genes.
- (Easy) Automation is possible but with a machine that locks the Megaspore into use. Breaking the machine doesn't give it back.
- While normal rock works fine, you can eventually upgrade to have an enclosure around it for better yields
